Learn how to take your application to the next level.  With the hapi.js workshop you will learn about the internals of hapi.js as well as how to use it to enable teams to build web applications and services. We'll run through how to create a micro-services tier using [Hapi.js](http://hapijs.com/) including distributed plugin development, testing hapi servers, builds, and deployment. Included will be the resources and knowledge to be able to help other groups do the same thing.
